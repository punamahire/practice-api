Write a function that fetches data from a resource. Your function should accept an argument that contains a string to the data source.

## Step One
Use the following variable
const dataSourceURL = "https://gist.githubusercontent.com/brendalong/ab2424b0069ed0dd56b01951462a109d/raw/716c0776c45adea089644cffa7eadab139f9f47c/womensday.json"

You should invoke the function with the dataSourceURL as an argument and then console.log the result.

## Step Two
Using the same function, invoke it with a different argument and console.log the result.

const dataSourceURL2 = "https://type.fit/api/quotes"

## Step Three
Based on the data, console log the total number of items (both results added together)
